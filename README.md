Uses Twitter API v2

## Usage/Examples

You first need to create a Twitter developer account. Since the launch of 
Twitter API v2 you can get access quicker than before by using the Essential
tier.

You will then need to create a .env.local file
Define your Consumer Key, Consumer Secret, Access Token Key and Access Token Secret

You can get these after you create a project under Projects & Apps in the Twitter developer platform.

Verify that in Settings, App permissions are set to Read and Write.

To test your bot locally, run the following command.
```node.js
npm run start-dev
```

After fleshing out the logic of your bot, deploy to your favourite provider!
